Never change
Never change or sway from that vibrant mood you are always in
Never change, don't let anyone bring you down, never let anyone 
make your day dim
Never change for no one because you are unique as snow is to
pass in the wind

Hidden face but your smile shines through
Crystal the name used for gemstones
Looking at your eyes I can see it's true
Some gemstones are rare but only one an be like you

Your soul is pure and I can tell the same for your heart
I'm thankfull for my work because we are a few steps apart
You brighten up my days from the first days when our 
conversations start

Till the next time we meet 
I would keep this short and sweet
Roses are Red
Violets are blue
I thank God that I got to meet
and would never forget you
